        <p class="lead mb-4"><br>My name is Melissa, I am a full time college student and I currently attend the University of California Riverside. I am planning to double major in Psychology and Philosophy Law and Society. I have a 3.8 GPA and planning to graduate with honors. I also participate in The National Society of Leadership and Success. I decided to major in Psychology when I joined a class in my senior year of high school. I loved going to class and learning about the different ways that the human mind functions, and the ways that it impacts our behaviors. I also really enjoyed studying the material, it never felt like work, I was just really interested and wanted to understand every concept to the best of my ability. I am also interested in Philosophy because I enjoy the intense thinking and questioning that goes into every assignment. I have taken a decent amount of these classes so it would be beneficial when I do declare. 
  I can integrate strategies to develop and expand existing organizational skills, analytical thinking, and a position that enables me to work closely and learn from other individuals. I have experience working at Moreno Valley City Hall as an Office Intern in the Economic Development Department. During my time there I Researched local cities for their “Resource Guides'' and made recommendations to “Moreno Valley's Small Business Guide”. I entered and updated business card contacts into Excel Spreadsheet, researched local cities and evaluated their “Shop Local” campaign, and organized collateral used for public distribution. Lastly, I would organize and assemblee binders for agenda documents, and compare OneNote contacts on linked Brochures. I also have a lot of experience aiding animals who are sick. I have tended and fed baby kittens who have been abandoned by their mothers and treated them to health. I have also tended to baby birds who have also been abandoned by their mothers. I had to feed them multiple times a day until they were ready to fly. After two months of caring for them, they were ready to fly and released into the wild. Rescuing these animals has given me the opportunity to become a foster parent. My most previous job has been at a Mexican Restaurant. I was the cashier and had to provide customer service. I was also required to speak both english and spanish and had to clean after people by throwing out their food, cleaning tables, walls, windows.
